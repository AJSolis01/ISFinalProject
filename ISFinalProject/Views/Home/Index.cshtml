                    There are all different kinds of stylist throughout the world. Some cut Mens Hair, others cut womens hair. Others work out of their house and style their clients from there. But what if that person doesn't have  platform in place
                    to schedule with their clients. Do they just have a piece of paper down to write down all of their appointments, or do they keep notes on physical calendar. Its not 2021, technology is in everyones pocket and most people have a cell phone
                    or some form of technology. With Style United, stylist can eleminate that physical calendar or piece of paper for the future. Style United allows for stylist to schedule upcomming appointments, ditching the physical calendar and going with the future.
